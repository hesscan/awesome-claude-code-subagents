3-Year Business Plan Financials

Context: You need a comprehensive financial model for strategic planning, fundraising, or board approval that projects the business forward 3 years with detailed assumptions.

Prompt Chain:

Step 1 - Build Comprehensive Assumptions Sheet

"Create an "Assumptions" sheet that serves as the single source of truth for all model inputs:

SECTION 1: REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS

Growth & Customer Metrics:

Starting customer count (as of [date])

Monthly/quarterly new customer additions (Year 1, Year 2, Year 3)

Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC) by year

Customer churn rate (monthly %) by customer segment

Price increases (timing and %)

Revenue by Stream (if multiple):

Product Revenue assumptions

Service Revenue assumptions

Other Revenue assumptions

Mix % by year

Customer Segmentation (if applicable):

Enterprise: % of customers, ARPC, churn rate, growth rate

Mid-Market: % of customers, ARPC, churn rate, growth rate

SMB: % of customers, ARPC, churn rate, growth rate

Seasonal Patterns:

Monthly revenue distribution (if seasonal)

Q1: X%, Q2: Y%, Q3: Z%, Q4: W%

SECTION 2: COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)

For each revenue stream, define:

COGS as % of revenue OR fixed cost per unit

Key drivers: hosting costs, payment processing fees, direct labor

Scaling assumptions: Does COGS % improve with scale?

Example for SaaS:

Cloud hosting: $X per customer per month, decreases 10% per year with scale

Payment processing: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

Customer support: $X per customer per month for first 1,000 customers, then economies of scale

SECTION 3: HEADCOUNT PLAN

Create a detailed hiring plan by department and year:

Engineering:

Starting headcount: X

Year 1 hires: +Y (specify quarters: Q1: +2, Q2: +3, etc.)

Year 2 hires: +Z

Year 3 hires: +W

Average salary: $X (with annual increases %)

Fully-loaded multiplier: 1.35x (includes benefits, taxes, equipment)

Repeat for each department:

Product Management

Sales (split by: Enterprise AEs, Mid-Market AEs, SDRs, Sales Leadership)

Marketing (split by: Marketing Leadership, Content, Demand Gen, Product Marketing)

Customer Success

Operations

Finance & Admin

Executive

For each role category, specify:

Base salary

Variable compensation (commission, bonus) as % of base

Ramp time (months until fully productive)

Quota/target (for sales roles)

...and so on for other sections like Operating Expenses, Capital Expenditures, and Working Capital Assumptions."

The video continues to show more detailed steps for this comprehensive plan, including building out the Revenue Model, Expense Model, Headcount Model, P&L Rollup, and Cash Flow Statement based on these initial assumptions. Each part is a separate, detailed step in the overall prompt chain.
